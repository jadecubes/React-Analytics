# React Analytics

This project integrates uses of Tiktok pixel, Facebook pixel, Google Analytics for collecting user events on any websites with React based frontend.

## Who Should Use This 

If you are looking forward to applying event collections of the mentioned platforms, you can use the module to integrate them all.

## How Do You Make Sure that the Code Can Work?
You can execute command below to run unittests to see the test result.

```
pnpm nx test analytics  
```

## Why Should You Trust the Code
The code confirms that all required data structions of <code>window</code> is initialized first, and events are sent to each platform after each of them is fully initialized. In other words, the events are only sent to each platform only after each of its <code>script</code>'s onload is called. If the onload is not called, the events are queued by the module and will be sent when the initialization is complete.

## Project Environment
This project is managed by <code>Nx</code> and developed by Visual Studio. So, install [Nx Console](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nrwl.angular-console) in Visual Studio. The bundler is vite and the unittest runner is jest.

## How to Use the Module
The recommended way is to first specify the user id in your application environment. You can take code in <code>apps/analyticsApp/main.tsx</code> and <code>apps/analyticsApp/.env.development</code>as an example.

After that, find the React component to whom you want to send events. The sample code shows below.

```typescript

import { useAnalytics } from '@analytics';

const { processAnalyticsEvent } = useAnalytics()
      processAnalyticsEvent({
        eventName: 'add_to_cart',
        eventParams: {
          country,
          count,
          // Any information you want to send
        }
      },
     // List platforms you want to send analytics events to
     [AnalyticsPlatforms.META, AnalyticsPlatforms.GA, AnalyticsPlatforms.TIKTOK]
)
```
